# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## [2.0.2]

### Fixed
- **Switch-only Node sizing**: Switch-type Nodes were inheriting the
  global AP circle/icon size sliders (since they're internally adapted
  to reuse the AP rendering pipeline). They now correctly use the same
  Switch Circle Size / Switch Icon Size / Switch Connected Devices
  sliders as the main Switch above the bus, so every switch in the
  diagram sizes consistently from one shared control.
- Confirmed (no change needed) that all Switch connecting lines already
  render solid rather than dashed by default.

## [2.0.1]

### Added
- **Switch-only Nodes**: a Node (in the Nodes menu) can now be a Switch
  instead of an Access Point - choose via the new "Node Type" selector
  at the top of each node's editor page. A Switch node supports its own
  icon, colors, offline state, and an optional Connected Devices count,
  hanging directly off the main bus line exactly like an AP node does
  today. Not eligible as a Primary node.

### Notes
This continues the Nodes architecture introduced in the previous
release. A Node combining a Switch with one or more of its own Access
Points (feeding a secondary T-bar) is a later addition - for now, a
Node is one or the other, not both together.

## [1.5.0]

### Changed (internal foundation - no visible behavior change)
- **Schema migration groundwork for an upcoming "Nodes" system**: the
  "Access Points" menu is now "Nodes", and the underlying config schema
  moved from a flat `access_points: [AP, ...]` array to `nodes:
  [{switch, access_points: [AP]}, ...]`. Existing saved configs migrate
  automatically on load - every existing AP becomes its own single-AP
  node with no switch, producing an identical rendered result to
  before. This is groundwork for a future release that will let a
  single Node contain a Switch feeding one or more Access Points; for
  now, every node still behaves exactly like a plain AP.

## [1.4.2]

### Added
- **AP Column Gap** slider (Advanced → Sizes) - controls the horizontal
  spacing between Access Point columns, so a large number of APs can be
  packed tighter to fit on screen instead of stretching off it. Was
  previously a fixed 32px with no way to adjust it.

## [1.4.1]

### Added
- **Switch Circle Size / Icon Size** sliders, and **Switch Connected
  Devices Circle Size / Icon Size** sliders (the side-branch previously
  had a fixed, non-configurable size) - all under Advanced → Sizes.

### Changed
- **Unified badge sizing**: the separate "Primary Badge Size"/"VPN
  Badge Size" slider pairs are now a single "Badge Size" / "Badge Icon
  Size" pair that controls all badge types together (Primary AP, VPN,
  and Firewall), since there was no real reason for them to size
  independently.

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **Switch node** - an optional node between Router and your Access
  Points, for setups with a managed switch distributing connectivity
  (e.g. a PoE switch feeding multiple APs). Only appears once an entity
  is configured (same pattern as Router). Supports its own icon,
  colors, offline state, and an optional Connected Devices count shown
  as a side branch (matching how LAN's Connected Devices renders off
  Router). Works correctly whether or not Router itself is configured,
  and correctly positions itself above a Tiered-layout Primary AP or
  directly above the Access Point row if there's no Primary AP.
- **Firewall badge** - mirrors the VPN badge exactly: single entity,
  "Applies To" target (Router or Primary AP), Animate when Offline, and
  full active/offline color and icon customization. Defaults to
  `mdi:wall-fire` with an orange background, positioned at the
  bottom-right of the circle (VPN stays top-right) so both can show
  simultaneously without overlapping.
- **Fully configurable summary**: choose any 3 items, in any order,
  from Download, Upload, Latency and Jitter, VPN Status, or Firewall
  Status (Advanced → Layout → Summary Item 1/2/3). Defaults to
  Download/Upload/Latency and Jitter, matching previous behavior. Each
  item only appears if its underlying entity is actually configured.

### Changed
- The **VPN** menu is now **Security**, housing both the VPN and
  Firewall sections together.

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- **Complete editor GUI overhaul**: every page reorganized into clear
  sub-sections with two-column color layouts - Internet
  (Internet/Billing/Metrics), Router (Router/LAN Connected Devices), a
  new dedicated VPN page, Access Point (Access Point/Backhaul/Connected
  Devices), and Advanced (Layout/Animation/Sizes).
- **VPN badge**: shows on either the Router or the Primary Access Point
  - pick one VPN entity and an "Applies To" target, and the badge
    appears wherever you've pointed it. Always visible once configured,
    switching between active and offline color sets based on the
    entity's state.
- **VPN "Animate when Offline"** toggle - the badge flashes when
  disconnected, so it's harder to miss.
- **VPN "Show in Summary"** toggle - replaces the Ping/Jitter summary
  badge with a VPN status readout ("VPN" / "Online" or "Offline"),
  matching the VPN badge's color scheme.
- **New "Connection Lines Color"** field per Access Point, used as the
  fallback color for single-line rendering when no download/upload
  entities are configured (previously silently reused the download
  color).
- Menu and list icons now use the theme's primary color throughout.

### Changed
- **LAN Connections** is no longer a top-level menu item - it's now a
  "LAN Connected Devices" sub-section within the Router page.
- **Primary AP badge**: combined the separate "Show in Tiered/Flat
  Layout" toggles into a single "Show Primary AP Badge" switch, with
  colors now set per-AP instead of globally.
- **Color picker layout**: every color selector across all pages now
  shows its label on its own row, with the swatch and hex input on the
  row below - much less cramped than the previous side-by-side layout,
  especially inside two-column sections.
- Badge and node sizing remain global settings, consolidated at the
  bottom of Advanced under "Sizes".

### Removed
- Router Status Entity picker from the editor (unused).

## [1.2.0]

### Added
- **VPN badge**: shows automatically on the Router and Primary AP nodes
  when a configured VPN-active entity reports "on". Customizable icon
  (defaults to `mdi:vpn`), background/icon/outline colors, and size -
  all under Advanced → VPN Badge. Configure the VPN entity itself on
  the Router page, or on an Access Point's page once it's marked
  Primary.

### Changed
- The Primary AP badge (Flat/Tiered layouts) now sits on the **left**
  side of the circle, making room for the new VPN badge on the right.

### Fixed
- **Offline detection now recognizes `not_home`.** Entities like
  `device_tracker`s (commonly used by network-device integrations such
  as UniFi for APs/switches) report `home`/`not_home` rather than
  `on`/`off`, and were previously never detected as offline by the
  card - only entities that became Home-Assistant-level `unavailable`
  were caught.

## [1.1.1]

### Fixed
- **Layout shifted sideways whenever an outermost AP went offline.** An
  offline AP renders an "X" marker instead of its normal connector line,
  and the alignment measurement was only looking for line elements -
  so an offline AP at either end contributed nothing to the leftmost/
  rightmost calculation, causing the whole layout to shift toward
  whichever AP was still online at that edge. The offline marker is now
  included in that measurement too.

## [1.1]

### Added
- **Primary Access Point** designation with two layout options:
  **Tiered** (promoted into the main trunk between Router/Internet and
  the rest of the topology) or **Flat** (stays inline with the other
  APs, marked with a customizable badge instead).
- **Primary AP badge**: custom icon, background/icon/outline colors,
  adjustable size, and independent show/hide toggles for Tiered and
  Flat layouts.
- **Reordering** for both Access Points and Individual Devices (move
  up/down within the editor).
- **Backhaul type icon** on each AP's connector line (wired vs.
  wireless), with a per-AP visibility toggle.
- **Global size controls**: circle and icon sizes for every node type
  (Internet, Router, LAN, Access Points, Connected Devices, Individual
  Devices) are now set once under Advanced settings, instead of being
  configured separately on every individual item.
- Download/Upload summary badges now hide independently when their
  entity isn't configured, instead of showing an empty placeholder.

### Changed
- All default colors now use Home Assistant theme variables instead of
  fixed hex values, so newly added nodes automatically match your theme
  (including dark mode). Still fully overridable per-element as before.
- Improved spacing between the card title and summary badges when
  positioned left or right.

### Fixed
- Extensive alignment fixes for the T-bar/bus-line connecting Access
  Points to the Primary AP or Router, covering uneven AP counts, dual
  vs. single bandwidth lines, a Primary AP with or without its own
  Connected Devices, and enlarged circle sizes. Alignment is now
  computed dynamically from actual rendered positions at render time,
  rather than relying on fixed layout assumptions.
- The Individual Devices connector line no longer disconnects in
  several edge cases (Primary-AP-only setups, Primary AP going offline,
  asymmetric AP layouts).
- The card's internal layering (z-index) is now fully isolated from the
  rest of the dashboard, so it can no longer visually conflict with
  other cards (e.g. custom navigation docks).
- Various single-line-fallback and offline-state rendering fixes for
  Internet, Router, and Access Point connectors when bandwidth entities
  aren't configured.

## [1.0.1]
- Added credit/acknowledgment for power-flow-card-plus as design
  inspiration (README and source header).

## [1.0.0] - Initial public release

First public release, packaged for HACS distribution.

### Features
- Internet, Router, LAN, and unlimited Access Point nodes with animated
  download/upload flow lines.
- Router is optional — hides automatically when no entity is set, with
  Internet's lines reconnecting directly to the Access Point layer.
- Per-node offline detection (`unavailable` / `unknown` / `off`) with
  pulsing warning icons, dimmed colors, and "X" markers on affected flow
  lines.
- Billing-cycle progress ring on the Internet node.
- Ping and jitter display on the Internet node.
- Primary Access Point designation and per-AP Backhaul Type entity
  (solid line for wired, dashed for wireless/mesh).
- Individual Devices section: an auto-sizing, dashed-bordered box tracking
  arbitrary entities with online/offline styling.
- Configurable summary badges (download/upload/ping/jitter) with
  top/bottom/left/right positioning.
- Smart single-AP layout collapsing to avoid a redundant one-branch T-bar.
- Full visual GUI editor covering every configuration option.
- Per-element color customization, with support for CSS/theme variables.
- card_mod compatibility.
